#####################

PowerShell is Microsoft’s new scripting language that has been built in since the release Vista. 

PowerShell file extension end in .ps1 . 

An important note is that you cannot double click on a PowerShell script to execute it. 

To open a PowerShell command prompt either hit Windows Key + R and type in PowerShell or Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Windows PowerShell -> Windows PowerShell.

dir 
cd 
ls
cd c:\


To obtain a list of cmdlets, use the Get-Command cmdlet

Get-Command
 


You can use the Get-Alias cmdlet to see a full list of aliased commands.

Get-Alias



Don't worry you won't blow up your machine with Powershell
Get-Process | stop-process 				What will this command do?
Get-Process | stop-process -whatif


To get help with a cmdlet, use the Get-Help cmdlet along with the cmdlet you want information about.

Get-Help Get-Command

Get-Help Get-Service –online

Get-Service -Name TermService, Spooler

Get-Service –N BITS

Start-Transcript 

PowerShell variables begin with the $ symbol. First lets create a variable

$serv = Get-Service –N Spooler

To see the value of a variable you can just call it in the terminal.

$serv

$serv.gettype().fullname
 

Get-Member is another extremely useful cmdlet that will enumerate the available methods and properties of an object. You can pipe the object to Get-Member or pass it in

$serv | Get-Member

Get-Member -InputObject $serv


Let’s use a method and a property with our object. 

$serv.Status
$serv.Stop()
$serv.Refresh()
$serv.Status
$serv.Start()
$serv.Refresh()
$serv.Status
 



Methods can return properties and properties can have sub properties. You can chain them together by appending them to the first call.
